 Q.1 Write tests for your smart contract and demonstrate
the process of testing using Hardhat Development
Environment.

Let's create a simple smart contract and write tests for it.

1. Create a new smart contract:

Let's create a simple smart contract called `SimpleStorage.sol` that stores an integer value.

```solidity
// SimpleStorage.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

2. Create a test file:

Now, create a test file for the `SimpleStorage` contract using Hardhat's testing framework. Create a file named `SimpleStorage.test.js` in  project's `test` directory.

```javascript
// SimpleStorage.test.js
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("SimpleStorage Contract", function () {
  it("Should set and get a value", async function () {
    // Deploy the contract
    const SimpleStorage = await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage");
    const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deploy();
    await simpleStorage.deployed();

    // Set a value
    await simpleStorage.set(42);

    // Get the value and check if it matches
    const storedValue = await simpleStorage.get();
    expect(storedValue).to.equal(42);
  });
});
```

3. Run the tests:

 Run the tests using the following Hardhat command:

npx hardhat test


Hardhat will compile  contracts, deploy them to a local Ethereum network, and run the tests. If all tests pass will see a success message.

4. Interpret the test results:

Hardhat will display the results of  tests in the terminal. Ensure that all tests pass without errors. If a test fails, will receive information about which test failed and what went wrong.

Q.2 Demonstrate the steps involved in the process of
deploying your smart contract to a live network.

Deploying a smart contract to a live network is a critical step in making your decentralized application (DApp) available to users. Below, I'll outline the steps involved in deploying a smart contract to a live Ethereum network, such as the Ethereum mainnet.  this process involves real cryptocurrency transactions, so exercise caution and ensure you have the necessary Ether (ETH) to cover the deployment costs.

Here are the steps involved in deploying your smart contract to a live network:

1. Verify and Test on Testnet:
   Before deploying  smart contract to a live network, it's highly recommended to test it on a testnet, such as Ropsten or Rinkeby. This allows you to identify and fix any issues without spending real ETH. Use a development framework like Hardhat or Truffle for local development and testing. Ensure that your contract functions as expected and passes all tests.

2. Prepare Deployment Scripts:
   You'll need deployment scripts to interact with the Ethereum network. Create a JavaScript or TypeScript file in  project to deploy contract using a Web3.js or ethers.js library. This script should include your contract's bytecode, ABI, and the Ethereum wallet or private key to sign transactions.

3. Configure Your Network:
   Ensure that  development environment is properly configured to connect to the Ethereum mainnet. You may need an Ethereum node provider like Infura or Alchemy. Configure your network settings with the necessary API keys and URLs in deployment script.

4. Fund Your Wallet:
   Make sure y Ethereum wallet contains enough ETH to cover the gas fees associated with deploying the contract. The amount required depends on the contract's complexity and the current gas prices on the network.

5. Deploy the Contract:
   Use  deployment script to initiate the deployment process. The script will compile your smart contract, create a transaction to deploy it, and send it to the Ethereum network for mining. Here's a simplified example using ethers.js:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const contractJSON = require("./build/contracts/YourContract.json"); // Load contract ABI and bytecode

async function deployContract() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(YOUR_NODE_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const contractFactory = new ethers.ContractFactory(
    contractJSON.abi,
    contractJSON.bytecode,
    wallet
  );

  const contractInstance = await contractFactory.deploy();
  await contractInstance.deployed();

  console.log("Contract deployed to:", contractInstance.address);
}

deployContract();
```

6. Monitor the Deployment:
   After initiating the deployment,  contract will be mined into a block. You can monitor the deployment process using a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. The deployment transaction will display the contract's address once it's confirmed.

7. Interact with  Contract
   Once deployed, you can interact with your contract on the live network by using its address and the contract's ABI. You can use wallets like MetaMask or custom applications to interact with the contract's functions and state.

Remember to take precautions when deploying to the live network, double-check all addresses and configurations, and understand the gas costs associated with your contract deployment. It's also a good practice to consider contract upgrades and maintenance for your DApp.
